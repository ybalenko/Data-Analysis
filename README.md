# Data-Analysis

This [repository](https://github.com/ybalenko/Data-Analysis) contains samples of data analysis using **Python** and **Pandas**. 
The initial dataset should be transformed and after that you should apply filters to answer the questions. 

The dataset, in CSV format was downloaded from [C15 here](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2018-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/7rac-kyay), [C16 here](https://data.wa.gov/Employment/High-School-Graduate-Outcomes-Earnings/39uh-rsgs/data)


*NOTES*:

[Pandas]( https://www.python.org) is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
